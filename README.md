A tool to create rectangular soft bodies of any size and specification, in jelly form.

The bodies are based off a spring-mass model. The spring constant, damping factor, spring length can be updated and the object will be serialised, saving the settings.

There are a number of issues to iron out, such as the points catching on eachother and the simulation breaking down at high spring constants. However, as a proof of concept to learn the technique, it works quite well.

I'm also hoping to create a 3D version, allowing me to experiment with making a translucent texture to make it appear more jelly-like.
